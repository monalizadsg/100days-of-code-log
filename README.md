### Day 4: August 1, Saturday

**Today's Objectives**:

- Finish Product landing page FCC Project

**Link to work:**

- [Product Landing Page](https://github.com/monalizadsg/fcc-projects/tree/master/product-landing-page "Product Landing Page")

**New thing(s) learned:** None for today.

**Thoughts:** Today, I took a break and did something like meal prepping(which will save me a ton of hours for the next days) and walking and getting fresh air outside. It feels nice and it's a way to keep away myself from burn-out. I was able to finish the project but my images can't be uploaded in codepen because I only have the free plan. I'm thinking about upgrading, but let me decide tomorrow.

**Thoughts:** I just realized that building projects are really helpful to gauge what I don't know yet. And for this, I will try to change the way I learn the concepts. I will build as I learn the concepts to fully understand it.
