**New thing(s) learned:** Today, I learned how to use libraries for form validation. I also practice to code my own validation without dependencies so I can learn how it works. But it is a bit verbose, so using some 3rd party library are recommended. It is wat more cleaner and organized.

**Thoughts:** And I am back! I noticed that I was kind of losing motivation for the last few days. Building a habit for the past two months cause me to burn out. I had a progress but not consistent. So, this challenge is helping me to track what I learned in a day. And I will keep doing it, no matter what. :) So, I will focus on the things that matter. Practice will pay off soon.

**Articles:** Here's the article I came across with today. It's a great article. It hit me. :)

**Link to work:**

- [Login Form](https://github.com/monalizadsg/components "Login Form")

**New thing(s) learned:** What I learned from the webinar is we have to be eager to learn, have the right strategy and believe in ourselves. If we are putting and pushing ourselves to do the uncomfortable things, then we have to do a delibrate practice to be comfortable with it and it doesn't stop there, we have to be constantly learning inorder to grow and learn the invaluable skills that will make us successful and achieve what we truly desire in life. Learning how to learn is one of the essential skill we should have.

**Thoughts:** Today, I got a migraine and a shortness of breath. I did the 'breathing on a paper bag' technique, it helped me to balance my breathing but my headache is still there. Took a med for the pain, rest for a while but it's still there. So yeah, this is due to the hot weather. So, I will only focus on the simple things right now.

**Thoughts:** There are many ways to solve a problem. I need to learn and practice on how to think of the right way to solve the problem. There are times that the solution I choose to take is not the right way, I got stucked for days but the thing is I still learned. That sometimes, you have to check if the solution you are taking is somehow the right way inorder not to waste a lot of time.
